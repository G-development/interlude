Testo introduttivo
Interlude doesn't tell a story, nor a specific place or time. It is the wait for something that never comes, a suspended moment where the present and the future blur without ever revealing themselves. In this space, every movement seems to repeat in an endless cycle, each gesture without conclusion. Time loses direction, but it is precisely in this indeterminacy that a sense of stasis is born.

What does it mean to wait? And what if nothing ever arrives? The figures brush past each other without truly meeting, their gestures and words remain incomplete. The distance between them, seemingly brief, is existential. It is not about finding an answer, but about exploring the meaning of a wait that leads to nothing, yet defines us in its very unfolding.

Interlude invites reflection on what we lack, on our need to arrive, to understand, and on how we often remain still, trying to define a void that cannot be filled. In this wait, perhaps the truth of who we are hides, but it never reveals itself completely.
